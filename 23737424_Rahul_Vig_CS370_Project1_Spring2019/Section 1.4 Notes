Section 1.4: Thermodynamic Definitions (Continued)

Now that we've figured out how to find the magnetization of spins 
and pair correlation per spin. We need to calculate the thermodynamic 
average of both m and cp.

The thermodynamic average values are denotes by <m> and <cp>
These are the weighted average values of m and cp at a Temperature T
	1. Introduce parameters B and C
	2. The energy of a configuration of spins sigma is given as follows:
	
	E(sigma) = - [Sum from i=1 to n] of (B*sigma[i] + C*sigma[i]*sigma[i+1])
	
	

public static double EnergyOfConfiguration(int B, int C, int sigma[], int n){
double energy = 0;
int j;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
j = i+1;

if(j >= n){
j = j % n;
}

energy += ((B*sigma[i]) + (C*sigma[i]*sigma[j]));


}
if((energy * -1) == (-0.0)){
  return 0;
}else{
  return (energy * -1);
}
}

<m> = Eq. 1.4.2a in Specs
<cp> = Eq. 1.4.2b in Specs

These equations will only work for n <= 20, however for larger n we must use
the Metropolis algorithm. 

Brute force gives us the exact answer, but computations is much to slow. 
Instead we must use a faster algorithm to get an approximate answer.
